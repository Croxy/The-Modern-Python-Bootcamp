# Ints and Floats

Python has two main ways to represent numbers. 

|Integer|Float|
 |--|--|
 |4|6.1|
 |57|1.3333|
 |-10|0.0|

Integers typically take up less space in memory.  
 
This is because when storing floats/decimals Python has to account for an infinite number of decimal points that could come after.  

There are also "complex" and "long" data types, but the use cases are rare. 


# Numbers and Math

Python Math Operators 

|Symbol|Name|
|--|--|
|+|Addition|
|-|Subtraction|
|*|Multiplication|
|/|Division|
|**|Exponentiation|
|%|Modulo|
|//|Integer Division|

In Python division always returns a float. 

Python follows the order of operations (PEMDAS). 

print(2 ** 3) #"**" indicates an exponent. 

print(49 ** 0.5) #Square root of 49 

print(10 % 3) #Modulo, kind of like division. AKA: The remainder operator. 

print(10//3) # // integer division, does the division, just returns an int. Always rounds down.
