### Simple Guessing Game

The "computer" player will pick a number, the human user will try to guess the number. If the human guesses to high or low the computer will respond with a hint saying as such. The game ends when the human player has correctly guessed the number.

### Advanced Rock, Paper, Scissors

Be able to actually play against the computer, it will keep score of who wins, best 2/3 etc... You will continue to play in a loop until someone has met the "victory" conditions.
